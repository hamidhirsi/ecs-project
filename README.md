This project contains the Terraform code and Dockerfile to deploy the **HyperTrio** web application on **AWS ECS Fargate**, behind a **public ALB with HTTPS**, using **ACM, Route 53**, and **Cloudflare** for DNS.

> ⚙️ Just edit a few values in `terraform.tfvars`, follow the steps below, and you're live.

---

## 🌐 Prerequisites

- AWS account (with permissions to manage ECS, ALB, ACM, ECR, Route 53)
- Created a domain on **Cloudflare**
- Terraform installed
- Docker installed
- AWS CLI configured using 'aws configure' command and AWS security credentials.

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. 🔧 Create a Public Hosted Zone on Route 53

- Go to **Route 53 → Hosted Zones → Create Hosted Zone**
- Domain name: `hypertrio.<your-domain>`
- Type: **Public hosted zone**

This will generate a list of **NameServers (NS)**.

---

### 2. 🌐 Update Cloudflare DNS

- Log into [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
- Go to your main domain (e.g. `example.com`)
- Under **DNS > Settings**, add 4 **NS records** with the ones from Route 53

> ⚠️ DNS propagation may take a few minutes.

---

### 3. 📦 Create an ECR Repository

In the AWS Console or CLI:

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name hypertrio
```

---

### 4. 🔐 GitHub Actions: Secrets Configuration

To enable the automated pipelines (Docker image build & push, Terraform deploy/destroy), add these repository secrets:

Go to:
GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

---

### 5. 🐳 Build & Push Docker Image
```bash
# Authenticate Docker to your ECR
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

# Build the image
docker build -t hypertrio .

# Tag the image
docker tag hypertrio:latest <your-ecr-url>/hypertrio:latest

# Push it
docker push <your-ecr-url>/hypertrio:latest
```

or

Run the **Build and Push Docker Image to ECR** workflow:
Go to: Actions → Build and Push Docker Image to ECR → Run Workflow → Type "yes"

---

### 5. ✏️ Then, Edit ***terraform.tfvars***

Update the values with your own:
```hcl
domain        = "hypertrio.example.com"
container_img = "<your-ecr-url>/hypertrio:latest"
exec_role     = "ecsTaskExecutionRole"
cpu           = 1024
memory        = 3072
dns_name = "app.hypertrio.<your-domain>"
dns_hosted_zone = "hypertrio.<your-domain>"
```

---

### 6. Deploy Terraform through CI/CD

Run the **Infrastructure Build Pipeline** workflow
Go to: Actions → Infrastructure Build Pipeline → Run Workflow → Type "yes"

---

### 7. ✅ Done!

After a couple minutes, visit your app!
```
https://hypertrio.<your-domain>
```
